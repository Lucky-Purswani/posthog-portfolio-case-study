# 🦔 Portfolio Analytics Case Study — Powered by PostHog  
*A fun, unplanned mini-project where I integrated PostHog into my portfolio to understand real user behavior.*

---

## 📌 Introduction  
This project started completely unplanned.  
While working on another idea, I came across **PostHog**, got curious, and decided to try it out on my own portfolio.

That one decision turned into a **4-day real analytics experiment**, where I tracked:

- traffic  
- sessions  
- interactions  
- device usage  
- user behavior  
- project clicks  
- social link clicks  
- and more  

All organically collected.

The entire analysis was designed using a **PostHog-themed presentation** inspired by their beautiful landing page.

---

## 🎯 Why I Did This  
- To understand how people actually use my portfolio  
- To learn real analytics hands-on (not just theory)  
- To explore PostHog’s capabilities  
- To improve UI/UX based on real data  
- To experiment with event tracking, page performance, and behavior insights  

And honestly — because the idea came unexpectedly and felt fun to try.

## 🛠 Tech Stack (My Portfolio Integration)
I integrated PostHog into a **Next.js portfolio** deployed on Vercel.

**Tech used:**  
- **Next.js** (App Router)  
- **JavaScript**  
- **PostHog JS SDK**  
- **Canva** (for case study slides)  
- **Vercel** (deployment)

## 📊 What I Tracked  
### **Traffic Insights**
- Visitors  
- Page views  
- Sessions  
- Device types  
- Countries  
- Traffic sources (Direct, Social, Search)

### **Interaction Insights**
Custom events I created:
- `contact_section_viewed`  
- `project_link_clicked`  
- `social_link_clicked`  
- User identification  
- Navigation patterns  
- Scroll behavior

---

## 🔍 Summary of Findings  
- Contact section was explored the **most**  
- Project and social clicks were **relatively low (~6 each)**  
- Traffic was almost equally split between **Mobile & Desktop**  
- Visitors came from **India, US, and UK**  
- Direct & social traffic dominated  
- Event tracking helped identify which sections need improvement  
- Users interacted more with the **upper half** of the portfolio

## 🧪 How I Collected Real Users  
This project wasn’t promoted artificially.  
I shared my portfolio with real communities to get genuine traffic:

- LinkedIn groups  
- GitHub discussions  
- Reddit (~400+ views)  
- Shared with peers and friends  
- Invited people to “check it out” because it sends live analytics events  

This gave me **authentic, organic user data**, not bots or fake traffic.

---

## 🚀 Future Plans  
- Integrate PostHog into all my upcoming projects  
- Add more custom events for deeper behavioral insights  
- Explore funnels, heatmaps, and session replays  
- Use analytics to redesign weaker areas of my portfolio  
- Try PostHog’s feature flags and A/B testing  
- Create client-ready analytics dashboards for real projects  

---

## 📍 Where PostHog Can Be Used  
PostHog works great for:

- Personal portfolios  
- SaaS dashboards  
- Mobile apps  
- Landing pages  
- E-commerce websites  
- Client analytics setup  
- Behavior studies  
- User testing  
- UX research  
- Startup MVP analytics  

Basically — anywhere you want to understand **what users really do**.
